Graduating to junior formulae in 2005, Ricciardo debuted in his regional Formula Ford championship. He won his first title at the 2008 Formula Renault 2.0 WEC with SG Formula, before winning the 2009 British Formula 3 Championship with Carlin. He then progressed to Formula Renault 3.5, finishing runner-up to Mikhail Aleshin by two points in his rookie season. Ricciardo made his Formula One debut at the 2011 British Grand Prix with HRT as part of the Red Bull Junior Team, replacing Narain Karthikeyan for the remainder of 2011. He earned a full-time drive with Toro Rosso in 2012 and 2013 alongside Jean-√âric Vergne, scoring several points finishes in each. Ricciardo was promoted to Red Bull in 2014, replacing the retiring Mark Webber to partner defending four-time World Drivers\\' Champion Sebastian Vettel.\\nIn his first season with Red Bull under Renault power,[b] Ricciardo finished third in the championship, taking his maiden victory at the Canadian Grand Prix, with further wins in Hungary and Belgium. After a winless 2015 campaign for Red Bull, he took his maiden pole position in Monaco and won the Malaysian Grand Prix in 2016, clinching third overall again. He took further wins for Red Bull at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in 2017, as well as the Chinese and Monaco Grands Prix in 2018. Ricciardo signed with Renault in 2019, finishing a season-best fourth in Italy. He retained his seat for his 2020 campaign, achieving multiple podiums and finishing fifth overall. He then joined McLaren in 2021 to partner Lando Norris, achieving his only victory and podium for the team at the Italian Grand Prix. Following inconsistent performances, Ricciardo left McLaren at the end of 2022 and returned to Red Bull as a reserve driver in 2023. From the Hungarian Grand Prix onwards, he replaced Nyck de Vries at AlphaTauri; he retained his seat for their 2024 campaign as RB, but was replaced by Liam Lawson after the Singapore Grand Prix.\\nRicciardo achieved eight race wins, three pole positions, 17 fastest laps, and 32 podiums in Formula One. Upon his retirement in 2025, he became the global ambassador for Ford Racing. Ricciardo was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in the 2022 Australia Day Honours.\\nRemove adsEarly life\\nDaniel Joseph Ricciardo[3] was born on 1 July 1989 in Perth, Western Australia, to Italian-Australian parents.[4]  His father, Giuseppe \"Joe\" Ricciardo, was born in Ficarra (Messina), but relocated to Australia with his family at age seven.[5]  Ricciardo\\'s mother, Grace Pulitan√≤ was born in Australia, but had parents originally from Casignana (Calabria).[6][7][8][9] Ricciardo also has a sister; Michelle.[10] Growing up in Duncraig, Ricciardo\\'s earliest memories of motorsports were of his father racing at the nearby Barbagallo Raceway in Wanneroo.[11] Raised Catholic,[12] he attended high school at Newman College.[13] He started karting at the age of 9.[14]\\nRemove adsJunior racing careerSummarizePerspective\\nRicciardo in October 2009\\nKarting\\nRicciardo started karting at the age of nine as a member of the Tiger Kart Club (TKC) and entered numerous karting events. \\nLower formulae\\nIn 2005, he entered the Western Australian Formula Ford championship driving a 15-year-old Van Diemen, finishing eighth by season\\'s end.[15]\\nTowards the end of the 2005 season, Ricciardo took a leased 13-year-old Van Diemen across to Sandown Raceway in Melbourne to compete at the national Formula Ford series, but his aging car was uncompetitive, and he finished 16th, 17th and retired during the weekend\\'s three races.[16]\\nThat year, Ricciardo was more successful in karts, in which he was crowned the Australian champion. His prizes for the win included a pass to the 2006 Australian Grand Prix at Albert Park, Melbourne, where the then-16-year-old savoured a taste of his own future by chatting unnoticed with Italian driver Jarno Trulli and Miss Universe 2004, Jennifer Hawkins.[17]\\nAfter finishing sixth in 2007 Formula Renault 2.0 Italia, Ricciardo was selected by Red Bull Junior Team.[18]\\nFormula Three\\nDuring the mid-part of the 2008 season, Ricciardo made his Formula Three debut at the N√ºrburgring, joining SG Formula\\'s Formula 3 Euro Series team. Despite only a short amount of experience in the car, Ricciardo qualified in eighth for the first race, which later converted into sixth in the race after James Jakes and Christian Vietoris stalled on the grid. But he struggled in the reverse-grid race, finishing just fifteenth.[19]\\nRicciardo moved to the British Formula 3 Championship for the 2009 season driving for Carlin Motorsport.[20] Ricciardo continued his partnership with Carlin by heading to the Macau Grand Prix with the team.[21]\\nFormula Renault 3.5 Series\\nOn 30 October 2009, Ricciardo was signed by Tech 1 to compete in the 2010 season.[22] He had competed with the team at the Aut√≥dromo Internacional do Algarve in Portugal in 2009 and was the teammate to Brendon Hartley, another driver who drove for Tech 1 over the season.\\nRicciardo in the 2011 Formula Renault 3.5 Series at the Circuit Paul Ricard\\nFollowing a minor incident during a mountain bike exercise, Ricciardo was forced to miss the second test of the 2010 season but went on to take pole position for both races at the season-opening round of the 2010 season in Alca√±iz, Spain. He finished third and second in the races respectively, to leave himself at the head of the championship standings. Two weeks later, at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit, Ricciardo was relegated to last on the grid after being deemed to have hindered the laps of other drivers. In the next two races, he finished 13th and fifth respectively\\xa0‚Äì coming 2nd in the latter, until many of the front-runners were given penalties for infringing the parc ferme rules before the race. One week later, in Monte Carlo, Ricciardo secured his third pole position of the season, finishing three-tenths of a second ahead of championship rival Stefano Coletti. He secured his first win at the following race, one place ahead of Coletti. Ricciardo went on to secure two more wins at the Hungaroring and at the Hockenheimring in commanding fashion. Following Ricciardo\\'s sixth pole from 12 races, Tech 1 team boss, Simon Abadie, praised his driver\\'s efforts greatly, saying, \"I am happy, and happy for Daniel because six poles in 12 races is good going,\" and later stated his team\\'s ambitions for success, by telling Autosport correspondent Peter Mills, \"I really hopes Daniel wins the championship.\"[23]\\nAt the first race at the Silverstone circuit, Ricciardo was involved in a spectacular incident with pole-sitter Jon Lancaster, in which Ricciardo was sent into a barrel roll, eventually landing on his wheels. The crash saw the end of his race, with teammate Jean-√âric Vergne becoming the eventual winner, following disqualifications. Securing pole for the second race of the weekend, Ricciardo spent much of the race leading the pack by upwards of three seconds. However, braking issues in the second half of the event meant that, on the final lap, championship-rival Esteban Guerrieri was able to pass the Tech 1 racer.[24]\\nGoing into the final round of the season, Ricciardo sat just three points behind championship leader Mikhail Aleshin and 13 ahead of third-place man Esteban Guerrieri. Managing his 8th pole of the season,[25] Ricciardo managed a lights-to-flag victory, setting the fastest lap and placing himself equal first with one race remaining.[26] After securing second place on the grid for the second race of the weekend, Ricciardo managed to hold position until the pit stops, where he was successfully \\'jumped\\' by two of his rivals, including teammate Vergne. With only two laps left in the race and struggling for pace, Ricciardo was overtaken by championship rival Aleshin. Finishing in that order, Ricciardo failed to secure the title in his debut year, losing out to Mikhail Aleshin by only two points.[27]\\nIn 2011 Ricciardo raced for ISR Racing prior to his HRT call-up.[28]\\nRemove adsFormula One careerSummarizePerspective\\nRed Bull test driver (2009‚Äì2011)\\nRicciardo as Scuderia Toro Rosso\\'s third driver at the 2011 Malaysian Grand Prix\\nRicciardo made his track debut at the wheel of a Formula One car when he tested for Red Bull Racing at the young drivers test at Circuito de Jerez over three days, starting on 1 December 2009.[29] On the final day of testing, he clocked the fastest time of the test by over a second. This placed him as the only driver to go into the 1:17 bracket.[30] Red Bull Racing\\'s team manager Christian Horner suggested that Ricciardo may replace his 2010 World Series teammate Hartley as the team\\'s test and reserve driver.[31] Ricciardo and Hartley went on to share test and reserve duties for both Red Bull and sister team Scuderia Toro Rosso[32] until the latter was removed from the Red Bull Junior team.[33]\\nOn 11 November 2010, Ricciardo was confirmed as the single driver to represent Red Bull Racing at the end-of-season young driver\\'s test at the Yas Marina Circuit, on 16‚Äì17 November.[34] Ricciardo continued to show his one-lap prowess and dominated the event, with his fastest lap being 1.3 seconds faster than 2010 World Champion Sebastian Vettel\\'s qualifying lap the Saturday before.[35] Days later, Ricciardo was confirmed as Toro Rosso\\'s test and reserve driver for the 2011 season and would take part in the first free practice session of each race weekend.[36][37] Franz Tost, Toro Rosso team principal stated that \"having a hungry youngster on the books will keep our current driver pairing nice and sharp\", referring to then Toro Rosso drivers Jaime Alguersuari and S√©bastien Buemi.[38]\\nHRT (2011)\\nRicciardo racing for HRT at the 2011 Italian Grand Prix\\nOn 30 June 2011, Ricciardo was loaned out by Red Bull to Hispania Racing (later rebranded HRT), replacing Narain Karthikeyan for the remaining eleven races of the 2011 season and partnering former Red Bull and Toro Rosso driver Vitantonio Liuzzi.[39][c] On the deal, HRT owner Jos√© Ram√≥n Carabante commented that he was \"proud that the Formula One world champion team has trusted us in their effort of developing their drivers\".[41] Ricciardo made his Grand Prix debut at the British Grand Prix,[42] where he qualified and finished last. Despite this, Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko described Ricciardo as \"full of potential\"[43] and suggested that he would likely one day replace Mark Webber at Red Bull Racing.[44]\\nOver his eleven races with HRT, Ricciardo recorded a best qualifying position of 21st at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, and best race finishes of 18th place at the Hungarian and Indian Grands Prix, leaving him 27th in the World Drivers\\' Championship. Writing in 2017, Sky Sports praised Ricciardo\\'s efforts in 2011, judging him to have \"[took] the fight\" to teammate Liuzzi.[45]\\nToro Rosso (2012‚Äì2013)\\nRicciardo driving for Toro Rosso at the 2012 Malaysian Grand Prix\\nRicciardo was promoted to a full-time race seat with Scuderia Toro Rosso for the 2012 season, partnering rookie Jean-√âric Vergne.[46] At the Australian Grand Prix, Ricciardo overtook Vergne late on the last lap to finish ninth, scoring his first two World Championship points.[47] His next points score would not be until eleven races later, where he qualified 16th and finished ninth at the Belgian Grand Prix.[48][49] This is despite having earlier qualified sixth at the Bahrain Grand Prix;[50] he dropped outside the points after a poor start and front wing damage.[51] Improved results for Ricciardo and the STR7 came in the latter stages of the year, with Ricciardo recording three consecutive points finishes at the Singapore, Japanese and Korean Grands Prix and a tenth-place finish at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.[52][53][54][55] In his first full Formula One season, Ricciardo finished 18th in the championship with 10 points, compared to 16 points for teammate Vergne.[56]\\nRicciardo at the 2013 Malaysian Grand Prix\\nRicciardo and Vergne continued at Toro Rosso for the 2013 season.[57][58] Ricciardo remarked that his target was to \"beat [Vergne] convincingly\" in order to earn a Red Bull Racing seat for 2014.[59] He began the year by not finishing the opening two rounds, both due to exhaust issues. He then scored his best Formula One result thus far with seventh at the Chinese Grand Prix.[60] Further points finishes came at the Spanish and British Grands Prix,[61][62] with Ricciardo having qualified a career-best fifth at Silverstone Circuit.[63] He again finished seventh at the Italian Grand Prix, having held off Romain Grosjean in the closing laps.[64]\\nRicciardo ended the season 14th in the standings with 20 points, ahead of Vergne\\'s total of 13.[65] During their time at Toro Rosso, Ricciardo qualified ahead of Vergne at 30 out of 39 races.[66] In September, he was chosen as the successor to the retiring Mark Webber at Red Bull Racing for the 2014 season.[67] Red Bull Racing team principal Christian Horner described Ricciardo as \"a big star of the future\",[68] and chief technical officer Adrian Newey explained that the team considered an experienced replacement‚Äîreports suggested that Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen was close to signing for the team[69][70][71]‚Äîbut that they ultimately decided to look within their junior roster, of which Ricciardo was the \"most promising\".[68]\\nRed Bull (2014‚Äì2018)\\n2014\\nRicciardo at the 2014 Spanish Grand Prix\\nRicciardo partnered reigning four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel for his first season at Red Bull,[72][73] which he predicted would be \"a great challenge\".[68] Issues for the team during pre-season testing sessions put doubt on their ability to win a fifth consecutive championship,[74][75] with Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko commenting that the team was only aiming to \"survive\" the season-opening Australian Grand Prix.[76] At his first Grand Prix with Red Bull, Ricciardo qualified second, ahead of Vettel,[77] and finished second behind the Mercedes of Nico Rosberg. However, Ricciardo was later disqualified as his car was judged to have breached regulations on fuel flow.[78] He then retired from the Malaysian Grand Prix after a pit stop error and a wing failure,[79] but recorded his first points of 2014 at the Bahrain Grand Prix, where he finished fourth after starting 13th.[80] He claimed his first Formula One podium five races into the season at the Spanish Grand Prix,[81] and followed this with another third-place finish at the Monaco Grand Prix, where he finished 0.4 seconds behind Lewis Hamilton.[82]\\nAt the Canadian Grand Prix, Ricciardo started sixth and gained three places during the pit stops. In the last four laps, he overtook Sergio P√©rez and Nico Rosberg to take the first win of his Formula One career.[83] This made him the fourth Australian to win a Grand Prix in Formula One, joining Jack Brabham, Alan Jones and Mark Webber.[84][85] The result promoted Ricciardo to third place in the World Drivers\\' Championship.[86] He later achieved back-to-back victories at the Hungarian Grand Prix,[87] where he overtook Hamilton and Fernando Alonso in the closing laps,[88] and at the Belgian Grand Prix after the Mercedes drivers collided.[89] Further podiums came at the Singapore and United States Grands Prix.[90][91] He ended the season with a retirement due to suspension failure at the Brazilian Grand Prix and fourth place at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix despite starting from the pit lane due to running an illegal front wing in qualifying.[92][93]\\nRicciardo ended his first season at Red Bull third in the World Drivers\\' Championship, having achieved three wins and five other podiums. He scored 238 points to Vettel\\'s 167, and was the only non-Mercedes driver to win a race in 2014. He received widespread praise for his performances, with 2014 champion Lewis Hamilton describing him as \"one of the best drivers here\"[94] and Fernando Alonso hailing him as \"unbelievable\" and \"very, very smart, very respectful\".[95] William Esler of Sky Sports described him as the \"standout performer\" of the season,[96] and he was ranked as the best driver of 2014 by Jamie Klein of Motorsport.com.[97] For his 2014 performances, Ricciardo won the Laureus World Sports Award for Breakthrough of the Year in April 2015.[98]\\n2015\\nRicciardo at the 2015 Belgian Grand Prix\\nFor 2015, Ricciardo was partnered at Red Bull by Toro Rosso graduate Daniil Kvyat following Vettel\\'s departure from the team to join Ferrari;[99] team principal Christian Horner opined that Ricciardo\\'s 2014 form was \"probably a factor\" in Vettel\\'s decision.[100] He finished the opening race at the Australian Grand Prix in sixth, the RB11 seemingly uncompetitive as he finished a lap behind the leaders, whilst teammate Kvyat broke down on the formation lap.[101] Horner described the car\\'s Renault engines as \"undriveable\" and Newey remarked that there was \"no obvious light at the end of the tunnel\".[102][103] Ricciardo\\'s engine failed on the final lap of the Bahrain Grand Prix‚Äîwhilst running in sixth‚Äîforcing him to use his fourth and final engine of the year after only the fourth race.[104] He achieved his first top-five finish of 2015 at the Monaco Grand Prix with fifth place and the fastest lap of the race.[105] Car issues led to a 13th-place finish at the Canadian Grand Prix,[106] followed by both Red Bulls receiving grid penalties for exceeding their engine parts allocations at the Austrian Grand Prix and a retirement with electrical problems at the British Grand Prix.[107][108]\\nThe team\\'s first podium finish of 2015 came at round ten, the Hungarian Grand Prix. Ricciardo and Nico Rosberg had made contact whilst battling for second place, but Ricciardo was able to finish third behind Kvyat despite stopping for a new front wing.[109] He recorded his second podium of the season at the Singapore Grand Prix, where he qualified and finished second, and set the fastest lap.[110] Ricciardo finished the season with 92 points in eighth place in the championship, compared to 95 points for Kvyat.[111] Red Bull failed to win a race for the first time since 2008, but Ricciardo commented that the season\\'s challenges had made him \"a more complete driver\".[112] Despite finishing behind Kvyat in the championship, Ricciardo qualified ahead of his teammate at twelve of the nineteen races.[113][114]\\n2016\\nRicciardo after winning the 2016 Malaysian Grand Prix\\nRicciardo began the 2016 season with fourth place at the Australian Grand Prix.[115] The new RB12 appeared more competitive than its predecessor; Ricciardo told the media that despite still being behind the leading Mercedes and Ferrari cars, the RB12 was \"not far off\".[116] He qualified second and led early on at the Chinese Grand Prix before a tyre failure dropped him back. He described his recovery to fourth as the best race of his career.[117] He gained a new teammate for the Spanish Grand Prix in 18-year-old Max Verstappen after Kvyat was demoted to Toro Rosso.[118] Despite initially leading the race when the Mercedes drivers collided on the first lap, a three-stop strategy and another tyre puncture left him fourth in the race whilst Verstappen claimed victory.[119][120] Ricciardo scored his first pole position at the Monaco Grand Prix and led the early wet stages of the race.[121] However, after a very long pitstop in which his team took nearly 40 seconds to ready a set of tyres, he lost the race lead to Lewis Hamilton and finished second.[122][123] Ricciardo was notably upset after the race result, saying: \"Two weekends in a row I\\'ve been screwed now. It sucks. It hurts.\"[124]\\nRicciardo returned to the podium five races later at the Hungarian Grand Prix and followed this with second-place finishes at the German and Belgian Grands Prix.[125][126][127] These results promoted him to third in the standings behind the leading Mercedes drivers.[128] He qualified and finished second at the Singapore Grand Prix, less than half a second behind winner Nico Rosberg.[129][130] At the Malaysian Grand Prix, he benefited from a collision between Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel and a late-race engine failure for Hamilton to win the race, his first victory in over two years.[131][132] Christian Horner praised Ricciardo and Verstappen for their mutual respect, the two having battled over second place earlier in the race.[133] Ricciardo later sealed third place in the championship with two consecutive podiums at the United States and Mexican Grands Prix.[134][135][136]\\nRicciardo scored a total of 256 points during the season‚Äîcompared to 212 in total for his Red Bull teammates‚Äîtaking a win, seven further podiums, his first pole position and four fastest laps. He was acclaimed for his performances; RaceFans, Motorsport.com and Mark Hughes at Motor Sport magazine rated him the best driver of 2016.[137][138][139] On his partnership with Verstappen, Ricciardo credited him with forcing \"a step up\" in his own driving.[140] Ricciardo became known during the season for his \"shoey\" celebration, first performed at the German Grand Prix, where he would pour champagne into his racing boot and drink out of it.[141] He persuaded others to drink from the boot, including podium interviewer Mark Webber,[142][143] team principal Horner and his fellow drivers.[144]\\n2017\\nRicciardo at the 2017 Malaysian Grand Prix\\nRicciardo qualified tenth at the Australian Grand Prix after spinning into the tyre barrier in Q3,[145] forcing him to fit a new gearbox and incur a grid penalty. He then started the race two laps down due to a gearbox sensor issue and ultimately retired with a fuel pressure problem.[146][147] Another mechanical retirement at round four, the Russian Grand Prix,[148] left him behind teammate Verstappen in the championship.[149] Ricciardo scored his first podium of the year at the Spanish Grand Prix‚Äîalbeit finishing over a minute behind the leaders[150]‚Äîwhich marked the start of five consecutive podiums. He finished third again at the Monaco Grand Prix having utilised an overcut to pass Verstappen and Valtteri Bottas,[151] and took another third place at the Canadian Grand Prix after Verstappen retired from second place.[152] At the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, a crash in qualifying and brake issues at the start of the race left Ricciardo in 19th place on lap five.[153] Multiple passes including a three-car overtake moved him up to third place, which became first place when Sebastian Vettel received a penalty and Lewis Hamilton was forced to pit to fix his loose headrest.[154] This secured his fifth Formula One race victory and promoted him to fourth place in the championship,[155][156] where he would remain for most of the season.\\nA turbocharger failure in qualifying at the British Grand Prix relegated him to 19th on the grid,[157] but he produced a recovery drive to finish fifth.[158] This was followed at the Hungarian Grand Prix by a collision between Ricciardo and Verstappen, which Ricciardo described as \"amateur\" and for which Verstappen apologised.[159] He returned to the podium at the Belgian Grand Prix,[160] with further top-three finishes at the Singapore,[161] Malaysian[162] and Japanese Grand Prix,[163] as well as a recovery to fourth place at the Italian Grand Prix having started 16th with an engine penalty.[164][165][166] The final four rounds of the season were impacted by mechanical issues for Ricciardo; he retired with an engine failure at the United States Grand Prix,[167] experienced a turbocharger failure at the Mexican Grand Prix,[168] was forced to take another engine penalty at the Brazilian Grand Prix[169] and retired from fourth place with a hydraulics failure at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. This allowed Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen to take fourth place in the championship from Ricciardo at the final race.[170]\\nRicciardo ended 2017 fifth in the World Drivers\\' Championship with 200 points to Verstappen\\'s 168, having recorded one win and eight other podiums. Despite his points advantage, Ricciardo qualified behind Verstappen at thirteen of the twenty races.[171] He was ranked the fourth-best driver of the year in an Autosport poll of the Formula One team principals.[172] Broadcaster James Allen rated him similarly; he praised Ricciardo\\'s performances as \"hard to fault\" but described Verstappen as a \"massive roadblock\" to Ricciardo\\'s future championship hopes.[173]\\n2018\\nRicciardo at the 2018 Austrian Grand Prix\\nRicciardo started the 2018 season with a fourth-place at the Australian Grand Prix from eighth on the grid after a three-place penalty for speeding under red flag conditions.[174][175] At the Bahrain Grand Prix, he recorded a non-finish after an electrical failure on the second lap,[176] the first of a series of mechanical issues that affected Ricciardo in 2018. He took a commanding victory at the Chinese Grand Prix by almost nine seconds after starting sixth on the grid.[177][178] Running sixth for majority of the race, he and Verstappen both pitted for fresher tyres under the safety car on lap 30. Ricciardo then overtook five cars in a span of eight laps to win the race.[179] Ricciardo and Verstappen collided whilst contesting fourth place at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, causing both cars to retire.[180][181] Following the race, Christian Horner stated that both drivers were ordered to apologise at the Red Bull factory.[182] Red Bull looked to be the favourites going into the Monaco Grand Prix, with Ricciardo breaking the lap record in practice.[183] He claimed his second career pole position and held off Sebastian Vettel\\'s Ferrari to win the race, despite losing the use of two gears and his MGU-K,[184] reducing engine power by 25%.[185][186] He described the result as \"redemption\" for having lost the victory in Monaco two years earlier.[187] His win lifted him to third in the standings,[188] but this would ultimately turn out to be his last podium of the season. \\nRicciardo suffered six reliability-related retirements in 2018.\\nFront wing damage and a late overtake by Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen denied Ricciardo a podium finish at the French Grand Prix.[189] Further mechanical issues began at the Austrian Grand Prix where he retired from fourth place with a suspected exhaust failure.[190] This was followed by a DRS failure in qualifying at the British Grand Prix,[191][192] and then and engine penalty and later an engine failure at the German Grand Prix.[193][194] He recovered from 12th on the grid to finish fourth at the Hungarian Grand Prix, but then suffered consecutive retirements at the Belgian and Italian Grands Prix, being caught up in a first-lap incident in the former and sustaining a clutch failure in the latter.[195][196] His engine failed again in qualifying at the Japanese Grand Prix,[197] but he was able to recover to fourth place in the race.[198] A battery failure then caused his elimination from the United States Grand Prix,[199] followed by a hydraulics failure at the Mexican Grand Prix, for which he had qualified on pole position.[200] After the race, Ricciardo insisted that his car was \"cursed\" and said that he \"didn\\'t see the point\" in doing the final two races of the season,[201][202] both of which he ultimately finished in fourth place.[203][204]\\nRicciardo ended the season sixth in the championship with 170 points to Verstappen\\'s 249,[205][206] and suffered eight retirements in twenty-one races. In August, he announced his shock departure from Red Bull after five years and revealed he would join Renault for 2019.[207][208] He stated that he was leaving Red Bull on good terms and said \"I leave proud and I feel like I\\'ve given the team my all and had that in return\".[209] ESPN and the Formula One team principals ranked him in their top five drivers of the year,[210][211] and Keith Collantine of RaceFans commented that Verstappen had the \"clear edge in outright speed\", but that Ricciardo\\'s \"dependable points-scoring made him an asset the team will be worse off without\".[212]\\nRenault (2019‚Äì2020)\\n2019\\nRicciardo at the 2019 Hungarian Grand Prix\\nRicciardo partnered Nico H√ºlkenberg at Renault for the 2019 championship.[213][214] He justified the move by saying he was looking for \"a fresh start somewhere else\"[215] and that he was encouraged by the team\\'s recent progress;[216] Renault\\'s World Constructors\\' Championship results were ninth, sixth and fourth over the previous three years. Christian Horner stated that Red Bull \"bent over backwards\" to keep Ricciardo, but gave his opinion that Ricciardo left to avoid playing a \"support role\" for Verstappen in the future.[217]\\nRicciardo began the season with retirements in the first two races. He collected damage from a broken front wing at the Australian Grand Prix,[218] then both Renault cars stopped almost simultaneously with power failures in the closing laps of the Bahrain Grand Prix whilst running in points-paying positions.[219] A first Q3 appearance followed at the Chinese Grand Prix,[220] before driving to his first points finish with Renault in seventh place.[221] At the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, Ricciardo reversed into Daniil Kvyat when both cars stopped after an overtake attempt by Ricciardo, causing race-ending damage for both drivers and Ricciardo\\'s third retirement in four races.[222] More points finishes came with ninth place at the Monaco Grand Prix and sixth place at the Canadian Grand Prix having qualified ahead of both Red Bulls in fourth.[223][224][225] He crossed the line in seventh place at the French Grand Prix having been embroiled in a four-car battle, but was given two separate five-second penalties on the final lap for driving infringements, dropping him out of the points.[226]\\nImproved results came in the second half of the season. Renault achieved their best result since returning to the sport in 2016 at the Italian Grand Prix,[227] with Ricciardo and H√ºlkenberg finishing fourth and fifth respectively.[228][229] He scored three consecutive points finishes at the Mexican,[230] United States[231] and Brazilian Grands Prix; he finished sixth in Brazil despite receiving front wing damage and a penalty after colliding with Kevin Magnussen.[232] However, retirements and car issues continued to affect his R.S.19. He suffered an exhaust failure at the German Grand Prix, took an engine penalty at the Belgian Grand Prix and then collided with Lance Stroll on the first lap,[233][234] and was stripped of his eighth-place qualifying position at the Singapore Grand Prix for a technical infringement.[235] He then retired after a first-lap collision at the Russian Grand Prix,[236] and was disqualified from a sixth-place finish at the Japanese Grand Prix; he had recovered from 16th on the grid,[237] but both Renault cars were excluded from the results ten days later having been found to have used illegal driver aids.[238]\\nRicciardo ended the season ninth in the World Drivers\\' Championship with 54 points, ahead of H√ºlkenberg\\'s total of 37. Renault finished fifth in the World Constructors\\' Championship, one place lower than in 2018 having been overtaken in the standings by McLaren. Ricciardo commented that the team had \"underachieved\"[239] in 2019 but that he was optimistic for 2020.[240] On his performance, ESPN\\'s Nate Saunders remarked that Ricciardo was \"probably the only consistent bright spot\" of Renault\\'s season, and whilst his decision to leave Red Bull was a competitive step down, his first year at Renault \"did little to tarnish his standing on the grid\".[241]\\n2020\\nRicciardo at the 2020 Tuscan Grand Prix\\nBefore the start of the 2020 season‚Äîwhich was delayed until July due to the COVID-19 pandemic‚Äîit was announced that Ricciardo would leave Renault to join McLaren for the 2021 championship in a series of driver moves triggered by Sebastian Vettel\\'s departure from Ferrari. On the early signing, Ricciardo commented that it may have been \"too late\" to make a decision on his future had he waited to assess the competitiveness of Renault\\'s new R.S.20.[242]\\nRicciardo had a new teammate for 2020, with H√ºlkenberg being replaced by former Mercedes reserve driver Esteban Ocon.[243] Ricciardo began the season with a retirement at the Austrian Grand Prix after his car overheated.[244] He then scored points at the following three races, including a fourth-place finish at the British Grand Prix where he benefited from late-race tyre punctures for Carlos Sainz Jr. and Valtteri Bottas.[245][246] He then qualified fifth for the following weekend\\'s 70th Anniversary Grand Prix,[247] but a spin during the race dropped him outside of the points.[248]\\nRicciardo scored points at all eleven remaining races of the season. Following the Belgian Grand Prix, where he qualified and finished fourth and set the fastest lap of the race,[249][250][251] Ricciardo praised a set-up discovery that had \"[brought] the car alive\"[252] and joked that Renault managing director Cyril Abiteboul should be \"pretty nervous\" about an agreement to get matching tattoos should Ricciardo achieve a podium finish in 2020.[253] He ran in the podium positions for much of the Tuscan Grand Prix, but finished fourth again having been overtaken by Alex Albon in the closing laps.[254] He qualified sixth at the Eifel Grand Prix and made his way to fourth place in the early laps.[255] After Bottas ahead retired, Ricciardo finished third, earning his first podium with Renault, and Renault\\'s first podium since the 2011 Malaysian Grand Prix.[256][257] A spin in qualifying at the Portuguese Grand Prix resulted in a tenth-place start and a ninth-place finish, which Ricciardo described as \"damage limitation\".[258] After qualifying fifth for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix,[259][260] the retirement of Max Verstappen and a strategy error by Sergio P√©rez\\'s team allowed Ricciardo to finish third, collecting his second podium in three races.[261] Contact with teammate Ocon and another spin at the Turkish Grand Prix resulted in a tenth-place finish,[262] but Ricciardo achieved top-seven finishes at the remaining three races of the season.[263][264][265]\\nRicciardo ended his final season at Renault fifth in the World Drivers\\' Championship, six points behind fourth-placed P√©rez. He scored 119 points to Ocon\\'s 62 and qualified ahead of Ocon at fifteen of the seventeen races.[266] Ricciardo described his 2020 as \"a really strong year\" and a turn-around after a disappointing 2019.[267] His performances were rated highly by team principals and fellow drivers.[268][269] Sky Sports pundit and former Formula One driver Karun Chandhok remarked that Ricciardo had \"rediscovered his form from the early Red Bull years\".[270]\\nMcLaren (2021‚Äì2022)\\n2021\\nRicciardo at the 2021 Austrian Grand Prix\\nRicciardo partnered Lando Norris during his time at McLaren.[271][272] He qualified sixth for his first race with the team at the Bahrain Grand Prix,[273] and finished in the points despite receiving damage from a collision with Pierre Gasly.[274] He scored points at the next three races, including a recovery from 16th on the grid to finish ninth at the Portuguese Grand Prix.[275][276][277] Following his Q1 elimination in Portugal, McLaren team principal Andreas Seidl gave his opinion that Ricciardo had struggled to adapt to the MCL35M, which \"[didn\\'t] allow him to continuously push the car at the limit\".[278] He finished ahead of Norris for the first time at the following race, the Spanish Grand Prix,[279] but was then lapped by podium-finisher Norris at the Monaco Grand Prix and failed to score points.[280][281] Top-ten finishes came at the Azerbaijan and French Grands Prix,[282][283] despite a qualifying crash at the former,[284] but a power loss demoted him outside the points at the Styrian Grand Prix.[285]\\nRicciardo achieved his best McLaren result thus far at the British Grand Prix, where he finished sixth in the sprint and fifth in the race, albeit behind fourth-placed Norris.[286] He commented that his form at McLaren was the \"sad reality\"[287] and had left him \"past the point of being frustrated\".[288] He was caught up in the first-corner collisions at the Hungarian Grand Prix and finished outside the points with damage.[289] He then qualified a season-best fourth at the Belgian Grand Prix, but the race was only run for two laps behind the safety car due to weather conditions and reduced points were awarded.[290] He qualified ahead of Norris at the Dutch Grand Prix,[291] but was denied a points finish when the team ordered him to concede position to Norris, who was on fresher tyres.[292] At this stage of the season, Ricciardo had scored less than half of Norris\\'s points total.[293]\\nRicciardo qualified fifth at the Italian Grand Prix, 0.006 seconds behind Norris, a result he described as enraging.[294] He gained two places during the sprint and then benefited from a grid penalty for Valtteri Bottas to start the main race on the front row alongside Max Verstappen.[295] He overtook Verstappen at the first turn and withstood pressure from the Red Bull until Verstappen was eliminated in a collision with Lewis Hamilton. He then held off Norris to take his eighth Grand Prix victory,[296] his first in over three years and McLaren\\'s first since the 2012 Brazilian Grand Prix.[297] He followed this with fourth place at the rain-affected Russian Grand Prix, three seconds behind a podium position.[298][299] He scored points twice more in the remaining seven races with fifth place finishes at the United States and Saudi Arabian Grands Prix, ahead of Norris in both.[300][301][302] However, he was eliminated in Q1 at the Turkish Grand Prix,[303][304] collided with Bottas and required a front wing change at the Mexican Grand Prix[305] and retired with a power unit issue at the S√£o Paulo Grand Prix.[306]\\nRicciardo ended the 2021 season eighth in the championship with 115 points compared to Norris\\'s 160. He admitted that he needed to \"make another [step] next year\" and summarised his season as \"Started not great, got better, but still with some dips.\"[307] Whilst praising his Italian Grand Prix victory, Edd Straw of The Race characterised most of his good results as being \"a consequence of canny race execution and a little good fortune\", and that he was \"a step behind his team-mate\".[308]\\n2022\\nRicciardo at the 2022 French Grand Prix\\nRicciardo missed the final day of the 2022 pre-season test at the Bahrain International Circuit due to a positive COVID-19 test,[309] but was released from isolation in time for the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix.[310] Both McLarens qualified and finished the race outside the top ten, with Norris admitting the team were \"a long way off\".[311] He was running in ninth place at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix before an engine failure eliminated him from the race,[312] but followed this with his first points of the season with a sixth-place finish at the Australian Grand Prix.[313][314] He scored points again in the sprint at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix,[315] but a collision with Carlos Sainz Jr. dropped him to the back whilst Norris went on to finish on the podium.[316] He then failed to score points in the next three races.[317][318][319] McLaren CEO Zak Brown admitted that Ricciardo\\'s performances had \"not met his or our expectations\"[320] and suggested that there were \"mechanisms\" in which Ricciardo\\'s initial three-year contract could be cut short.[321] He next scored points at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix where he started 13th and finished eighth.[322][323] A DRS failure forced an extra pit stop and a 13th-place finish at the British Grand Prix,[324] but Ricciardo then recorded two consecutive points finishes with ninth place at both the Austrian and French Grands Prix.[325][326]\\nIn July, amongst speculation over his future at McLaren, Ricciardo stated that he was committed to McLaren until the end of 2023 and that he was \"not walking away from the sport\".[327] However, in August it was announced that Ricciardo\\'s contract had been terminated and that he would leave McLaren at the end of 2022.[328] He would be replaced by former Alpine reserve driver and Formula 2 champion Oscar Piastri, who, it later emerged, had signed a contract with McLaren in early July.[329] Ricciardo finished no higher than 15th at the following four races, however he was in eighth place at the Italian Grand Prix before retiring with an oil leak, having initially ran in the top three on the opening lap.[330] This was followed by his best result of the season at the Singapore Grand Prix, where he finished fifth despite starting 16th.[331][332] He recorded a seventh-place finish at the Mexico City Grand Prix despite receiving a ten-second penalty for colliding with Yuki Tsunoda,[333] but this was followed by a race-ending collision with Kevin Magnussen at the S√£o Paulo Grand Prix.[334] He received a three-place grid penalty for the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix as a result of the collision,[335] but recovered to finish the race ninth.[336][337]\\nThe 2022 championship ended with Ricciardo 11th in the standings, scoring 37 points to Norris\\'s 122, with McLaren losing fourth place in the World Constructors\\' Championship to Alpine by 14 points. He was out-qualified by Norris at twenty of the season\\'s twenty-two races.[338] Writing for Sky Sports, Matt Morlidge described Ricciardo\\'s season as \"tough to watch\", and on his contract termination, suggested that McLaren \"had little option but to look elsewhere\".[339] During the Japanese Grand Prix weekend, Ricciardo admitted that he would not be on the grid for 2023, but stated that he planned to remain involved in Formula One with a view to returning to a race seat in 2024.[340]\\nRed Bull reserve driver and AlphaTauri / RB (2023‚Äì2024)\\n2023\\nRicciardo elected to re-join Red Bull as their \"third driver\" for 2023. He specified that his role would involve \"simulator work, testing sessions and commercial activities\".[341] Team principal Christian Horner commented that \"to have a driver of Daniel‚Äôs profile and history with the team within the group is only an asset for us\". However, he ruled out a return to a race seat for Ricciardo,[342] and advisor Helmut Marko clarified that Red Bull Junior Team driver Liam Lawson would fulfil reserve driver duties for Red Bull and AlphaTauri.[343] On 11 July, Ricciardo took part in a Pirelli tyre testing session at Silverstone Circuit, driving the Red Bull RB19.[344] Hours later, it was announced that he would return to a race seat with AlphaTauri, replacing Nyck de Vries with immediate effect.[345] This marked his return to the team previously known as Toro Rosso, for whom he last raced in 2013. Multiple writers characterised the move as an audition for Sergio P√©rez\\'s Red Bull seat,[346][347] with Christian Horner mentioning this as a possibility upon the expiration of P√©rez\\'s contract at the end of 2024.[348]\\nAt the Hungarian Grand Prix, his first race with the team, Ricciardo qualified 13th and recovered to 13th in the race having been involved in a first-lap collision.[349] He had a lap time deleted in qualifying at the Belgian Grand Prix and qualified and finished in the bottom five.[350][351] During the second free practice session of the Dutch Grand Prix, Ricciardo hit the wall in an attempt to avoid Oscar Piastri\\'s crashed McLaren. The incident broke a metacarpal bone in Ricciardo\\'s hand in seven places.[352] The injury prevented him from competing for the remainder of the weekend and forced him to miss the following four races. He was replaced by reserve driver Lawson.[353][354] He returned to racing at the United States Grand Prix,[355] but brake issues led to a 15th-place finish.[356] Ricciardo then qualified a season-best fourth for the Mexico City Grand Prix and finished the race seventh, earning his first points with AlphaTauri and the team\\'s best result of the year.[357][358][359] He came close to scoring a point in the S√£o Paulo Grand Prix sprint, finishing ninth,[360] but suffered a broken rear wing after it was hit by a loose tyre during the main race.[361] He ended the season 17th in the championship, scoring six of the team\\'s 25 points over his seven appearances.\\n2024\\nRicciardo at the 2024 Chinese Grand Prix\\nRicciardo was retained by the team, which had rebranded to RB,[362] for 2024 alongside Yuki Tsunoda.[363] Horner remarked that having Ricciardo, Tsunoda and Lawson at the team was \"a nice headache to have\" and that Lawson would have a race seat in the future.[364] Ricciardo commented that a Red Bull seat for 2025 remained his goal.[365] The beginning of Ricciardo\\'s 2024 season was impacted by incidents; he spun on the final lap of the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix,[366][367] had his lap time deleted in qualifying at the Australian Grand Prix,[368] collided with Alex Albon at the Japanese Grand Prix[369][370] and was rear-ended by Lance Stroll at the Chinese Grand Prix.[371] At the Miami Grand Prix, he qualified and finished fourth in the sprint having held off the Ferrari of Carlos Sainz Jr.[372] He commented that the result would \"keep a few people quiet\".[373] His next points finish came at the Canadian Grand Prix, where he qualified fifth and finished eighth.[374] Prior to qualifying, he received criticism from 1997 champion Jacques Villeneuve who questioned why he was still in Formula One. After qualifying, Ricciardo responded by saying Villeneuve was \"talking shit\".[375]\\nRicciardo scored further points at the Austrian Grand Prix, where he finished ninth,[376] and at the Belgian Grand Prix, where he was classified tenth after race-winner George Russell\\'s disqualification.[377] During the summer break, discussions on the Red Bull and RB driver line-ups were held at Red Bull\\'s Milton Keynes headquarters.[378] Sergio P√©rez\\'s position at Red Bull seemed uncertain; Horner had described his results as \"unsustainable\"[379] and Ricciardo was a candidate to replace him.[380] RB CEO Peter Bayer also stated that the team would have \"quiet discussions\" on a promotion for Lawson;[381] Helmut Marko had earlier commented that RB \"is a junior team\" and that Lawson should be given a seat soon.[382] Ultimately, no changes were made.[378][383] However, four races later at the Singapore Grand Prix, speculation arose as to whether Ricciardo would be dropped from the team following the race.[384] He finished the race 18th and pitted for fresh tyres to set the fastest lap of the race on the penultimate lap. He appeared emotional after the race, admitting that it could have been his last.[385] Four days later, his departure from the team was confirmed, with Lawson replacing him from the United States Grand Prix onward.[386][387]\\nRicciardo ended the season 17th in the championship with 12 points,[388] compared to Tsunoda\\'s 22 points up to and including the Singapore Grand Prix. Motor Sport\\'s James Elson stated that Ricciardo had been \"summarily outperformed\" by Tsunoda during 2024,[389] and Jake Boxall-Legge of Autosport branded his move back to the Red Bull stable a \"waste of time\".[390] On his departure from the sport, Ricciardo commented that he was proud of his career, and that \"truth be told I wouldn\\'t change it\".[391]\\nRemove adsDriver profileSummarizePerspective\\nDriving style\\nRicciardo is known for his aggressive style as well as favouring a late braking manoeuvre to engineer overtakes. Ricciardo also prefers to carry more speed through the corner by making it more of a \\'U\\' shape, utilising a little rear instability on entry to turn in, and enough grip to rotate the car mid-corner without the rear breaking away.[392]\\nPublic image\\nRicciardo at the 2021 United States Grand Prix\\nRicciardo was regarded as one of the most prominent names in Formula One,[393] known for his laid back nature and smile, with The New York Times describing him in 2016 saying, \"If a survey could be made of the 22 Formula One drivers to establish who smiles the most, has the sunniest disposition and seems to be generally the nicest guy, Ricciardo would surely be the leader.\"[394][395][396][397] His personal profile grew with the success of the reality show Drive to Survive, where he has been called \"the face of the show\".[394][398][399] After the 2021 season, Ricciardo was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in the 2022 Australia Day Honours for \"significant service to motor sport as a competitor and ambassador, and to the community\".[400][401]\\nRicciardo is often referred to as \"the honey badger\" referencing his racing style, explaining how \"[i]t\\'s supposed to be the most fearless animal in the animal kingdom. When you look at it, he seems quite cute and cuddly, but as soon as someone crosses his territory in a way he doesn\\'t like, he turns into a bit of a savage and he\\'ll go after anything ‚Äì tigers, pythons ‚Äì he turns very quickly, but he\\'s a good guy.\"[402][403]\\nOn 8 February 2015, during the third episode of series 22 of the popular British motoring television programme Top Gear, Ricciardo became the fastest Formula One driver to perform a lap of the Top Gear test track during the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car feature, beating the previous record-holder Lewis Hamilton with a time of 1:42.2.[404]\\nRemove adsPersonal lifeSummarizePerspective\\nRicciardo pronounces his surname \"Ricardo\" (/r…™Ààk…ëÀêrdo\\xa0ä/ ‚ìò) instead of the Italian pronunciation ([ritÀàt\\xa0Éardo], with a \"ch\"-sound), attributing this to the way it was usually pronounced growing up in Australia and by his family.[3][405] Growing up as a fan of NASCAR Cup Series driver Dale Earnhardt, Ricciardo adopted the number 3 as his permamanent racing number in Formula One in his honour.[406] Ricciardo supports Australian rules football club West Coast Eagles and was the club\\'s number-one ticket holder in 2015 and 2016.[407][408] He is also a UFC fan and, during the course of his Formula One career, developed an affinity for American football team Buffalo Bills.[409][410] He further supports Twenty20 cricket club Melbourne Stars, as childhood friend and Australian cricketer Marcus Stoinis represents the team.[411]\\nRicciardo is in a relationship with Heidi Berger, the daughter of 10-time Formula One Grand Prix winner Gerhard Berger.[412] In 2019, he founded the eponymous kart racing series, the Daniel Ricciardo Series (DRS), to provide affordable access to owner‚Äìdriver karting for drivers aged 7‚Äì16; it has since expanded to an arrive-and-drive format.[413] Notable graduates include 2024 GB4 Championship runner-up and F1 Academy race-winner Alisha Palmowski.[414] Ricciardo retired from motor racing in September 2025, aged 36, to become an ambassador for Ford Racing.[415]\\nRemove adsAwards and honours\\nFormula One\\nLorenzo Bandini Trophy: 2014[416]\\nOther awards\\nLaureus World Sports Award for Breakthrough Performance of the Year: 2015[417]\\nGQ Australia Sportsman of the Year: 2014[418]\\nConfartigianato Motori Driver of the Year: 2014, 2018[419][420]\\nBRDC Bruce McLaren Trophy: 2013, 2014, 2016[421][422][423]\\nBRDC Innes Ireland Trophy: 2014, 2015[422][424]\\nOrders and special awards\\nKentucky\\nHonorable Order of Kentucky Colonels (2021)[425]\\n\\xa0Australia\\n Member of the Order of Australia (2022)[400]\\nSpecial awards\\nConfartigianato Motori Legend of F1 Award: 2024[426]\\nRemove adsKarting record\\nKarting career summary\\nMore information Season, Series ...\\nSeason\\nSeries\\nPosition\\n\\n2000\\nBob Smithers Memorial\\xa0‚Äî Junior Clubman\\n5th\\n\\n2005\\nAustralian CIK Championship Series ‚Äî Intercontinental A\\n1st\\n\\nAustralian National Sprint Kart Championship\\xa0‚Äî Junior Clubman\\n10th\\n\\n2010\\nVan der Drift Fundraiser\\nDNF\\n\\nSource:[427][428]\\nClose\\nRacing recordSummarizePerspective\\nRacing career summary\\nMore information Season, Series ...\\nSeason\\nSeries\\nTeam\\nRaces\\nWins\\nPoles\\nF/Laps\\nPodiums\\nPoints\\nPosition\\n\\n2005\\nWestern Australian Formula Ford Championship\\nPrivateer\\n3\\n0\\n0\\n?\\n0\\n74\\n8th\\n\\n2006\\nFormula BMW Asia\\nEurasia Motorsport\\n19\\n2\\n3\\n3\\n12\\n231\\n3rd\\n\\nFormula BMW UK\\nMotaworld Racing\\n2\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n3\\n20th\\n\\nFormula BMW World Final\\nFortec Motorsport\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\nN/A\\n5th\\n\\n2007\\nFormula Renault 2.0 Italy\\nRP Motorsport\\n14\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n196\\n6th\\n\\nEurocup Formula Renault 2.0\\n4\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\nNC\\n\\n2008\\nFormula Renault 2.0 WEC\\nSG Formula\\n15\\n8\\n9\\n7\\n11\\n192\\n1st\\n\\nEurocup Formula Renault 2.0\\n18\\n6\\n5\\n5\\n7\\n136\\n2nd\\n\\nFormula 3 Euro Series\\n2\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\nN/A\\nNC\\n\\nMasters of Formula 3\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\nN/A\\nNC\\n\\n2009\\nBritish Formula 3 Championship\\nCarlin Motorsport\\n20\\n7\\n6\\n5\\n13\\n275\\n1st\\n\\nMasters of Formula 3\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\nN/A\\nNC\\n\\nFormula Renault 3.5 Series\\nTech 1 Racing\\n2\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n34th\\n\\nMacau Grand Prix\\nCarlin\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\nN/A\\nNC\\n\\n2010\\nFormula Renault 3.5 Series\\nTech 1 Racing\\n17\\n4\\n8\\n5\\n8\\n136\\n2nd\\n\\n2011\\nFormula Renault 3.5 Series\\nISR\\n12\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n144\\n5th\\n\\nFormula One\\nHRT Formula 1 Team\\n11\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n27th\\n\\n2012\\nFormula One\\nScuderia Toro Rosso\\n20\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n10\\n18th\\n\\n2013\\nFormula One\\nScuderia Toro Rosso\\n19\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n20\\n14th\\n\\n2014\\nFormula One\\nInfiniti Red Bull Racing\\n19\\n3\\n0\\n1\\n8\\n238\\n3rd\\n\\n2015\\nFormula One\\nInfiniti Red Bull Racing\\n19\\n0\\n0\\n3\\n2\\n92\\n8th\\n\\n2016\\nFormula One\\nRed Bull Racing\\n21\\n1\\n1\\n4\\n8\\n256\\n3rd\\n\\n2017\\nFormula One\\nRed Bull Racing\\n20\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n9\\n200\\n5th\\n\\n2018\\nFormula One\\nAston Martin Red Bull Racing\\n21\\n2\\n2\\n4\\n2\\n170\\n6th\\n\\n2019\\nFormula One\\nRenault F1 Team\\n21\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n54\\n9th\\n\\n2020\\nFormula One\\nRenault DP World F1 Team\\n17\\n0\\n0\\n2\\n2\\n119\\n5th\\n\\n2021\\nFormula One\\nMcLaren F1 Team\\n22\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n115\\n8th\\n\\n2022\\nFormula One\\nMcLaren F1 Team\\n22\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n37\\n11th\\n\\n2023\\nFormula One\\nScuderia AlphaTauri\\n8\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n6\\n17th\\n\\n2024\\nFormula One\\nVisa Cash App RB F1 Team\\n18\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n12\\n17th\\nClose\\nComplete Formula BMW Asia results\\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position;
